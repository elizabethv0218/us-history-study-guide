    <div class="container bg-3">
        <p><b>Geography</b> played a huge role in the development of America from the arrival of the first migrants to the start of <b>American colonialism.</b></p><br>

        <h4>The First Migration</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li>The nomads from northeast Asia were the ones who first arrived in the Western Hemisphere between 12,000 and 45,000 years ago. These nomads hunted for big game like the wooly mammoths to survive.</li><br>
                <li>They traveled over Beringia, a land bridge, across the Bering Strait from Siberia to Alaska. Many consider these Paleo-Indians, or Asian migrants, to be the first Americans.</li><br>
                <li>After many millennia, the climate grew warmer and groups of nomads migrated further south. In the early 1400’s, Europeans began their own migrations to the New World.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Geography of the United States</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">Located on the North American continent is the United States and it holds many significant geographical features.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Oceans</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Atlantic Ocean is located on the East Coast of the United States and the Pacific Ocean on the West Coast, giving coastal areas moderate climates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Rivers</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Mississippi River extends from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico for 2,320 miles. This river links multiple rivers, therefore, connecting the country.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Other Bodies of Water</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Great Lakes is found on the Northern border connecting the U.S. and Canada.</li>
                        <li>The Gulf of Mexico is found south of the U.S. from Texas to Florida and is connected to the Mississippi River.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Mountains</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Appalachian Mountains are between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River.</li>
                        <li>The Rocky Mountains (the Rockies) are east of the Great Plains and have the highest peaks in the country.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>The Great Plains</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>West of the Mississippi River. Its flat terrain makes it great for cultivation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Impact on the History of the U.S.</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li>American colonies were able to be developed because of the bodies of water that made trading networks possible, specifically the Atlantic Ocean. This has resulted in a growing population and has made way for urbanization.</li><br>
                <li>The nation’s policy of noninvolvement was motivated by geography. After all, the great Atlantic Ocean separated the North American continent from Europe and allowed the U.S. to avoid war.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Native Americans & The First Encounter</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Native American Perspective</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Native Americans view European settlers as deceitful people who came to rob their land. They believe these white people exploited their hospitality and repaid them by bringing weapons and alcohol.<br><br>When they arrived to the
                            New World, they imposed their laws and customs on the natives and created a social hierarchy where the natives were on the bottom. European settlers are the ones who enslaved and killed them which makes them the enemy. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>European Settlers’ Perspective</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many European settlers believed it was their duty to civilize Native Americans by giving them articles of clothing & converting them into Christians, for instance. They believed the indigenous people were barbarians and inferior,
                            so they thought enslaving them was a suitable action. The Europeans learned that tribes of natives were very different from how they ran their society.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Early Forms of Government</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">After the development of early colonies, progression was occurring in what is now known as the state of Virginia.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The House of Burgesses</b> was the first legislative body in the colonies created by the Virginia Company.<br><br>Representatives were elected by landowners for the House to create laws to maintain peace and security in the colony of
                    Virginia. There were 22 members, one who was a governor chosen by Englishmen, 6 who were his council and the rest who were elected by landowners.<br><br>Initially, the Virginia Company approved of the laws, but it dissolved when Virginia
                    got controlled by the English government.</li><br>
                <li>In Massachusetts, regular <b>town meetings</b> for town actions became a tradition. Citizens would vote on laws and went along a majority rule. Voting citizens were male, white, Christian landowners.</li><br>
                <li>The Pilgrims who arrived at Cape Cod, Massachusetts were persuaded to sign a pledge, the <b>Mayflower Compact (1620)</b>. In it, the Pilgrims declare they have undertook the voyage for their faith & loyalty to the British monarch. They
                    explain that they are establishing a colonial government to maintain order & civility and vow to follow the laws & policies that are issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>The Chesapeake Region</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">This region included the Southern colonies of Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virgina.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Virginia Company developed Jamestown Colony in 1607. Its warm climate and rainfall allowed colonists to cultivate staple crops:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tobacco</li>
                        <li>Rice</li>
                        <li>Sugarcane</li>
                        <li>Indigo</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    As populations in the colonies grew rapidly, more workers were required for the settlers to survive. Indentured servants were used to resolve the labor shortage because many settlers paid for the servants’ journey to the U.S. so that they could work for
                    a number of years and then gain freedom to live in America. Unfortunately, their rights were limited Their master:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Would need to give permission for marriage;</li>
                        <li>could whip their indentured servants; and</li>
                        <li>Could extend the period of years servants would work for.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>Eventually, indentured servants’ labor was replaced by that of purchased & enslaved Native Americans and Africans. The region’s warm & wet climate made the land fertile and made way for the creation of plantations. Because working conditions
                    in the plantations were harmful, white laborers refused to work in them, therefore Africans worked in them. This is why slavery was so common in the South.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>New England Region</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">This region included the northern colonies of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlike the Chesapeake Region, there were no plantations. Instead, this region’s most common occupations were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Farmers</li>
                        <li>Merchants</li>
                        <li>Seamen</li>
                        <li>Fishermen</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>The region’s economy was developed through the colonists who would catch fish and participate in trading networks since they were along the East Coast. Neighboring waters held the greatest amount of cod fish and whales which provided oil.
                    These fishing activities led to the shipbuilding business which opened trade and shipments to other colonies and Europe.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>The Middle Colonies</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">This region included the colonies of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The region’s geography played a role in shaping its unique aspects. The Atlantic Ocean allowed people, trading, new ideas, and lifestyles to make their way to America. Therefore, there were a diverse set of perspectives found in the Middle
                    Colonies. Its fertile land allowed the growth of its staple crops:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wheat</li>
                        <li>Barley</li>
                        <li>Oats</li>
                        <li>Livestock</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>The Middle Colonies also had a fur trade with the Native Americans. All these factors contributed to the region’s prosperity.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>The French and Indian War (1754-1763)</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li>The French and Indian War was a conflict between Great Britain and France over Indian land claims in the Ohio Valley which supposedly had fertile land. Both nations wanted to control the Ohio Valley in order to control the North American
                    continent. War was declared on May 1756.</li><br>
                <li>After the war, England gained more land from France in the Americas. The Treaty of Paris (1763) gave Great Britain France’s possessions east of the Mississippi River. Spain benefited from the treaty as is obtained control over the Louisiana
                    Territory.</li><br>
                <li>King George III wanted to maintain peace with the Native Americans, so he issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 that drew a proclamation line along the Appalachian Mountains. This line prevented white settlers to expand westward so they
                    wouldn’t disturb the indigenous people. Ten thousand British soldiers were sent to enforce the Royal Proclamation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>The British System</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li>Salutary Neglect - law regulating American colonies were not heavily enforced.</li><br>
                <li>Mercantilism - when a government controls economic activities to strengthen the nation. Industries were managed, taxed or supported by the government. This policy led to global empires.</li><br>
                <li>The colonies strengthened other nations by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supplying gold, silver, grains, fish, furs, indigo, sugar, tar, timber, tobacco, etc.</li>
                        <li>Creating a market where colonial customers bought goods in England.</li>
                        <li>Not producing goods that would rival the ones from Great Britain.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>The Navigation Act of 1651 said that all colonial/British goods would be shipped via British ships.</li><br>
                <li>The Navigation Act of 1660 said that colonial goods would be shipped to Great Britain and its territories only.</li><br>
                <li>The Navigation Act of 1663 said that goods shipped to the U.S. had to be offloaded and taxed in England before being shipped.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>British Acts on the United States</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Sugar Act of 1764</b><br>The British Parliament issued a direct tax on sugar to prevent smuggling sugar into the colonies and to gain money to decrease the debt from the French and Indian War.</li><br>
                <li><b>The Currency Act of 1764</b><br>The Currency Act made it illegal for colonial governments to create paper currency, even though it was deemed necessary for trade. Taxes and debts were to be paid to British merchants in British currency.</li><br>
                <li><b>The Quartering Act of 1765</b><br>King George III had sent British soldiers to the colonies for their protection against the French and Natives. This act forced colonists to house and care for these British soldiers.</li><br>
                <li><b>The Stamp Act</b><br>Individual colonists would pay taxes imposed on papers like the newspapers, advertisements, degrees, etc. This act was hated, so colonists would tar and feather those who would collect their taxes.</li><br>
                <li><b>Townshend Acts of 1767</b><br>Parliament wanted to prevent the smuggling of goods into America, so they believed it was fair to tax American importations. This increased the power soldiers had to check whether or not there were signs
                    of smuggling activity.</li><br>
                <li><b>Coercive Acts of 1774</b><br> The colonies had to pay for the damages that were made during the Boston Tea Party. Boston’s harbor closed, a military government was imposed, and quartering was reinforced.</li><br>
                <li><b>The Tea Act of 1773</b><br>Taxes on imported goods were revoked, but the tax on tea remained. Parliament wanted to give the East India Company a tea monopoly in the colonies since they were in a financial crisis. This act was an effort
                    to end tea smuggling.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Enlightenment Philosophers</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>John Locke believed that a strong government was dependent on capable, rational men who were willing to find middle ground with their beliefs.</li>
                        <li>Locke’s Two Treatises of Government explained how absolute monarchies were not an acceptable form of government. A representative government that protects citizens’ inalienable rights and has their loyalty is the best alternative.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</b>

                        <li>Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed that citizens should not be restrained by the limits in society. His epic The Social Contract conveys his belief that a direct democracy is the best form of government.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li><b>Charles Montesquieu</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Charles Montesquieu’s book The Spirit of Laws is based off of Locke’s beliefs and explains the importance of division of state and powers. The powers refer to what we know as the legislative power, the executive power, and the
                            judicial power.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Thomas Paine felt that Great Britain was imposing many injustices on the colonies and believed colonist should have their voices heard in the government.</li>
                        <li>His pamphlet Common Sense shows how he was vehemently against being ruled by a monarchy and he motivates the colonies to separate from England.</li>

                <li>Britain had a large, organized military both on land and on the Royal Navy. Their troops had veterans who had experience from the French and Indian War. America had unexperienced militiamen, a small navy, and a population a third of that
                    of England’s. Additionally, it didn’t have a lot of money nor an industry for weapons. Its asset was George Washington who helped train the Continental Army.</li><br>
                <li>Colonists were motivated to gain victory because they wanted to protect their land, people, and independence. Fortunately for them, most colonists were patriots who were willing to fight against British forces. Patriots’ biggest advantage
                    is the fact that they were more familiar with the terrain and climate in North America.</li><br>
                <li>During winter, George Washington had led troops across the Delaware River which ended in a victory for the Patriots and boosted their morale. Another victory by the Continental Army was made at Trenton followed by another one at Princeton.</li><br>
                <li>When Patriots won the Battle of Saratoga, the French began to support the U.S. in what is known as the Franco-American Alliance of 1778. France provided weapons, military leaders, ships, troops, and money. One year later, the U.S. gains
                    Spain’s support. The following year, the Netherlands became another ally.</li><br>
                <li>The American Revolutionary War ended when all 5 countries negotiated on the Peace of Paris granted the U.S. western territories and recognized their independence.</li>
