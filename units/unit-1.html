                                        to the New World, they imposed their laws and customs on the natives and created a social hierarchy where the natives were on the bottom. European settlers are the ones who enslaved and killed them which makes them
                                        the enemy.

                                        and inferior, so they thought enslaving them was a suitable action. The Europeans learned that tribes of natives were very different from how they ran their society.</li>

                                As populations in the colonies grew rapidly, more workers were required for the settlers to survive. Indentured servants were used to resolve the labor shortage because many settlers paid for the servants’ journey to the U.S. so that they could work for
                                a number of years and then gain freedom to live in America. Unfortunately, their rights were limited Their master:

                                    <li>Would need to give permission for marriage;</li>
                                    <li>could whip their indentured servants; and</li>

                            <li>Eventually, indentured servants’ labor was replaced by that of purchased & enslaved Native Americans and Africans. The region’s warm & wet climate made the land fertile and made way for the creation of plantations. Because
                                working conditions in the plantations were harmful, white laborers refused to work in them, therefore Africans worked in them. This is why slavery was so common in the South.</li>
