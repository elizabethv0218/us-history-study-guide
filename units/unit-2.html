                        <p style="font-size:100%">Constitutional Flexibility says that the Constitution is capable of meeting the changing needs of Americans. Article 1 Section 8 gives Congress the power to make laws that are necessary and proper. This is known as the elastic
                            clause because it stretches the government’s power. It allows the authority of the government to expand and meet unforeseen circumstances. The Constitution can be formally changed through amendments.<br><br>The amendment process
                            allowed the Constitution to deal with major changes to the government. Only 27 Amendments have been added and they’ve helped deal with national crisis while preserving rights. People have very little say in the Amendments because
                            the Founding Fathers feared direct democracy.</p>

                            <li><b><i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i></b><br>Ohio didn’t recognize the gay marriage of Obergefell and John Arthur who married in Maryland. Obergefell was not listed as a Arthur's surviving spouse. South Carolina ruled in favor of
                                marriage equality and overturned the ban on same sex marriage. These bans were unconstitutional because they violated due process and the equal protection clause.</li><br>
                            <li><b><i>McCulloch v. Maryland</i></b><br>The U.S. government had a national bank in 1791. Alexander Hamilton believed the government had the power to make another bank. Thomas Jefferson disagreed. President James Madison believed
                                the country needed a national bank and asked Congress to make a second one which was approved. The states opposed these national banks because they competed with state banks, bank managers were believed to be corrupt, and
                                they believed the government was becoming more powerful. Maryland passed a law to force outside banks to pay a state tax of $15,000 to close down the Baltimore branch. James McCulloch worked in that branch and refused to
                                pay. Maryland believed it had the power to tax any business in its state. Their rationale was that if the national government could regulate state banks, then Maryland is allowed to regulate national banks. The Constitution
                                doesn't let Congress create a national bank. McCulloch was convicted so he appealed to the Maryland Court of Appeals. His lawyer said the national bank was necessary and proper. Therefore, Maryland cannot tax the national
                                bank because it hinders the national bank’s job. The court agreed in favor of McCulloch. In the end, Federal laws beat state laws.</li><br>
                            <li><b><i>Gibbons v. Ogden</i></b><br>Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston had a monopoly for steamboats on the waterways of New York. The monopoly was given by the New York state government because it was very profitable. Aaron
                                Ogden had a Fulton-Livingston license and operated between New Jersey and New York. Thomas Gibson didn’t have this license, but he had a federal coasting license. The waterway was interstate, so commerce trade was across
                                states. Ogden believed New York should control the waterway. Gibbons argued that Congress had power over the waterway. If each state made laws about interstate commerce there would be chaos. Ogden won in New York. The Supreme
                                Court ruled in favor of Gibbons because Congress had the power to regulate these operations. Once again, the federal license overpowers the state license.</li><br>
                            <li><b><i>Texas v. Johnson</i></b><br>Gregory Lee Johnson burned an American flag to protest against President Ronald Reagan. The laws in Texas said that that was a criminal offense, so he was convicted. This is a violation of
                                his first Amendment.

                            <li><b><i>Mall v. Ohio</i></b><br>Cleveland officers received a tip that Miss Map was in possession of many gambling slips, and that a bomber was hiding in her home. Police arrived with no warrant and left, but they returned and
                                went inside without a warrant. Bomb making materials were found and she was arrested. This was a violation of her 4th Amendment.</li><br>
                            <li><b><i>New Jersey v. T.L.O.</i></b><br>A teacher saw two girls smoking in the bathroom, so they were taken to the principal's office. The vice principal searched one of the student’s purse and found cigarettes, rolling paper,
                                marijuana, a pipe, plastic bags, money, lists of names, letters which were signs of drug dealing. The student said that was unconstitutional violated her 4th Amendment. However, it was a reasonable search and the safety
                                of the students had to be ensured.</li><br>
