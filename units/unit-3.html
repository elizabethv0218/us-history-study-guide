            <ul>
                <li>During George Washington’s presidency, Americans were forcing Native Americans off their land which prompted the Natives to attack the Americans. President Washington told Congress that the security of the citizens had to be preserved.
                    Although peaceful methods were used to maintain peace (i.e. treaties), they were successful. He believes it necessary to use military forces to push the Natives from their land.</li><br>
                <li>The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 doubled U.S. territory and came with new citizens, cultures, and resources. The U.S. paid France $15 million for what would become the West. For Americans, this land meant opportunity, but for the French
                    and Spanish (in America), it was a threat to their culture. The purchase increased the power of President Thomas Jefferson. Fifteen states were formed and they included the states of Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.</li><br>
                <li>President Jefferson was aware of the concern that expanding U.S. territory would possible risk the nation’s union. Nevertheless, he believed that a larger nation would not be so easily influenced by local issues and that it was best that
                    the West be under their control rather than by another country.</li><br>
                <li>John Quincy Adams had established a foreign policy that would prioritize national interests over regional ones (i.e. expanding the nation’s territory).</li><br>
                <li><b>The Monroe Doctrine</b><br> The Monroe Doctrine declared that the Americas were independent and will not be subject to colonization by a European country. Only the U.S. will able to expand in the Americas. The U.S. will be neutral to
                    European wars, unless the interests & rights of the nations are threatened.

                <li>The Louisiana Purchase made Americans desire westward expansion. “Manifest Destiny” was a belief that Americans had the God-given right to expand the U.S. from the East Coast to the West Coast and spread democracy, regardless of who inhabited
                    the West.</li><br>
                <li>Many Americans were attracted by the land that moving to the west would offer. Southern farmers moved to the west because they wanted more land to cultivate more cotton and gain more profits. Miners also traveled to the west when rumors
                    of gold and silver were spread. During this period, the telegraph and railroad were being developed which allowed travelers to continue to travel faster and have a way to communicate if they went to the West.</li><br>
                <li>Unfortunately, westward expansion forced Native Americans and herds of animals to leave their land again.</li>

                <li>After President Andrew Jackson was elected and the discovery of gold in Georgia, citizens demanded an immediate removal of Native Americans. In 1830, the Indian Removal Act was passed and said that Native Americans who lived southeast
                    of the Mississippi had to move to reservations.</li><br>
                <li>In response, the Cherokee claimed the law was illegal. Worcester v. Georgia was a Supreme Court case where the Chief Justice, John, Marshall, ruled in favor of the Native Americans because they were independent and should keep their natural
                    rights.</li><br>
                <li>Despite all this, the President overreached his power to continue enforcing the law. As a result, 15,000 Cherokee were moved into reservations through the Trail of Tears. These Natives had to travel on foot during the winter and autumn
                    for around a thousand miles. The duration of the journey was around 115 days and a quarter of them died.</li>

                    <li>President James Polk’s goal was to expand U.S. territory as he believed in Manifest Destiny. President Polk was among those who wanted land from Mexico.</li><br>
                    <li>In 1821, Mexico had gained independence from Spain who had controlled them for centuries. Mexico was not able to create a secure government with a prosperous economy and it was this instability that made Americans want to take advantage
                        of Mexico. Mexico had territories that are now southwestern states.</li><br>
                    <li>So many Americans had settled in Texas that they outnumbered the number of Mexicans who already lived there. The settlers did not want to follow Mexican laws, so they fought to gain independence for Texas in 1836. Mexico was angered
                        when Texas won independence in the Texas Revolution and called itself the Lone Star Republic.</li><br>
                    <li>The Republic had to deal with a lot of debt and eventually voted to be annexed by the U.S. Mexico believed that the U.S. had violated a treaty and both nations disagreed over where the border was.</li><br>
                    <li>Because Mexico was not willing to sell more land, President Polk decided war was the answer. American troops were sent to land claimed by both countries, and Mexico followed suit. Polk persuade Congress to declare war when he heard
                        that Mexican troops fired first. The Mexican-American War ended in 1847, when U.S. troops seized Mexico City. Mexico had to agree to ceding almost a million acres of land and a new border was negotiated upon in the Treaty of Guadalupe
                        Hidalgo. The U.S. gained territory that is known as the states of California, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, and New Mexico. The Mexican government received $15 million dollars for the land.</li>

                    was greater than that of the British population and American settlements were spreading. They wanted the U.S. government to gain complete control over the territory and President Polk was willing to go to war. England was not willing
                    to engage in war because the territory was far from the home country. The Buchanan-Pakenham Treaty moved the border between the U.S. and British Canada towards the west.</li><br>
                <li>Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna was Mexico’s leader and had to manage many rebellions, so he sold some land to the U.S. to pay his army to end the rebellions. The U.S. obtained land that is known as Arizona and New Mexico for $10 million.</li>
