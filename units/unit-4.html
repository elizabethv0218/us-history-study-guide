                <p style="font-size:100%">The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it easy to legally seize enslave any black man or woman at large. When a slave escapes to another territory or state the slave owner may pursue & reclaim the slave and use any reasonable force & restraint
                    necessary to take & remove such fugitive person back to where they escaped from. A slaves testimony will not be admitted as evidence in a trial or hearing.<br><br>Anyone who knows or prevents a slave owner, his agent or attorney, from
                    arresting a fugitive or attempt to rescue a slave from the custody of the slave owner’’s shall be subject to a fine of at most $1,000 and imprisonment not exceeding 6 months.<br><br>A white man only had to swear ownership of the black
                    person and request a certificate for arrest. The law gave Commissioners greater payment if they ruled in favor of the slave owner. $10 for issuing a certificate and $5 for refusing it. It was an era of slave hunting and those who escaped
                    fled to Canada.<br><br>Abolitionists tried to undermine the Fugitive Slave Act through legal tactics, social protest or violent resistance and most northern states intentionally neglected to enforce the law. Free blacks were kidnapped
                    by bounty hunters and sold.</p>

                    <li><b>Harriet Beecher Stowe and <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i></b><br>There was a powerful religious set of ideas during the Abolitionist Movement. Stowe helped runaway slaves and detested the Fugitive Slave Act. Uncle Tom's Cabin was a success
                        selling 300 copies in the U.S. and more than a million in Great Britain at the end of its first year. It revealed the brutal realities of slavery that harmed everyone associated with it and it enraged slaveholders.

                        black woman to win the case against a white man. She toured the country giving speeches about justice & equality and became an abolitionist leader. She wanted American society to recognize black women's capabilities and demand
                        for their equal standing.</li><br>

                        the most well-known abolitionist in the U.S. and slave owners despised him. In fact, Georgia legislature placed a $5,000 bounty on his head and he received numerous death threats from white Southerners, but he remained committed

                    to cut off all communication with the North and treat them as an enemy. They did not want to submit to the North because they were a “tyrant brother”. The South could not wait to be a free and independent people.</p>
