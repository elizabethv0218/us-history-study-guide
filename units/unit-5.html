                <ul>
                    <li>The Thirteenth Amendment (1865) says that slavery and involuntary servitude shall not be legal, unless it is as a punishment for a crime. Therefore, people who work must give their consent and be paid.</li><br>
                    <li>The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) says that people who are born or naturalized in the U.S. will have the privileges or immunities of U.S. citizens, they will not be denied of their natural rights, and will be protected by U.S. laws.
                        The Fourteenth Amendment also establishes the idea of citizenship & equal protection under the law. This is the first time in which African Americans are viewed as people rather property.</li><br>
                    <li>The Fifteenth Amendment (1870) says that U.S. citizens will have the right to vote regardless of their background. Consequently, Congress gains more power and citizens are not meant to be discriminated against. However, this amendment
                        does not address women.</li>

                <p style="font-size:100%">Immediately after the Civil War, troops were sent to the South to protect newly freed African Americans. Congress established the Freedmen’s Bureau to provide food, schooling, medical care, and clothes to freedmen. The Bureau was made
                    in an effort to help African Americans to settle in their own land through labor contracts with white landowners. Freedmen were also assisted by regaining the connection with family members who were separated and to legalize marriages.
                    Unfortunately, the Bureau only operated for a year which was not enough time to resolve the all problems in the South. White resistance made the Bureau fail to help freedmen settle in their land.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Freedmen’s Bureau School were free and taught African Americans crafts & skills for economic independence. Women learned how to sew and men learned trading skills.</li><br>
                    <li>Congress began to have black members. After the 15th Amendment, African Americans tried running for different elected positions. They were able to have a say in making changes in the U.S. government.</li><br>
                    <li>Black owned businesses that served their communities rose African Americans into the middle class - a sign of social mobility. This was necessary because white owned businesses didn’t want to collaborated with African Americans.</li><br>
                    <li>African American families and people would move to the West to obtain land because they were able to buy land at cheap prices and farm for themselves.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Many white southerners were resentful towards the result of the Civil War and they resisted efforts of reconstruction. At this time, President Johnson was finding loopholes in the Reconstruction Amendments and passing laws that would
                        deny the civil rights of African Americans.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Black Codes</b><br>Eventually, all southern states passed Black Codes that limited the freedom of African Americans.
                        <ul>
                            <li>African Americans had to sign work contracts with working conditions that were similar to those of slavery. They would be arrested if they couldn’t prove that they were employed and be sentenced to a year of labor without being
                                paid.
                            </li>
                            <li>African Americans were not allowed to bear arms.</li>
                            <li>African Americans could only rent property in cities.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Apprentice Laws</b><br>The Apprentice Laws in Mississippi and South Carolina required orphaned children and children with unfit parents (deemed by the Probate Court) to find work as an apprentice with former owners having top priority.
                        Their masters could inflict punishment and recapture them if they ran away. The masters were required to provide their apprentices food, clothing, and schooling.</li><br>
                    <li>Republicans were angered by the Black Codes because the South was regressing. In return, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was passed to give African Americans equal legal rights as white Americans. President Johnson vetoed the act because
                        it discriminated against white people and gave the government too much power. Regardless, his veto was overridden by Congress for the first time in history and he lost support.</li><br>
                    <li>Because Johnson did not support Reconstruction, Congress limited his power with a law that prevented the president from removing officials from the cabinet without the approval of the Senate. When President Johnson fired his secretary
                        of war the House of Representatives voted to have him impeached. A trial in the Senate followed, but Johnson was not convicted by one vote. Nonetheless, his power was greatly weakened.</li>

                <p style="font-size:100%"> Freedmen wanted land of their own to gain economic independence. Although the Freedmen’s Bureau had helped them gain land, President Johnson had reversed those efforts. Tens of thousands of freedmen had to return to their land to white
                    owners. Freedmen had to become farmworkers to survive in the system of sharecropping. This system basically re-enslaved African Americans because they couldn’t leave their work without permission from landowners. If they left, they
                    were left homeless, jobless, and arrested. Sharecropping was a cycle of poverty as shown below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sharecropper is given land & seed and promises to give half the crop to the landowner.</li><br>
                    <li>Sharecropper buys food & clothing from landowner’s store.</li><br>
                    <li>Sharecropper will plant and harvest crop.</li><br>
                    <li>The landowner is given crop to sell. Sharecropper receives half the earnings but pays his debt to the landowner for the year.</li><br>
                    <li>As the sharecropper settles up, the landowner will say that more money is owed in comparison to his earnings.</li><br>
                    <li>The sharecropper promises to give the landowner a greater share of next year’s crop to pay the debt.</li><br>

                        he was an eighth black. When Plessy refused to move, he was arrested, tried, and convicted. Plessy appealed and said that he had been denied protection under the law which was stated in the Reconstruction Amendments.</li><br>
                    <li>The Supreme Court ruled against Plessy because the state’s law on segregation did not violate the 14th Amendment. In other words, separate treatment did not mean that African Americans were inferior. They also said that the quality
                        between the White Only car and Jim Crow car was pretty similar. Justice Marshall Harlan disagreed with the ruling and said that the Constitution should be “color-blind”. He believed the court ruling has committed and disguised
