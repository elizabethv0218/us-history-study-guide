        <h4>American Progress</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">America was the first manufacturing nation in the world 25 years after Lincoln's death and rose to industrial supremacy. It has been building a manufacturing economy since the early 1800s. In the early 1800s, the Industrial Revolution brought new technology and industries to the US. Factories and machines did much of the work that used to be done by hand. By the 1920s it had become the leading industrial power in the world which is why it is called the Second Industrial Revolution. Factors include New Uses of Natural Resources, government support for businesses and innovation and a growing Urban population. The urban population provided cheap labor and markets for new products.<br><br>White Southerners wanted to see a vigorous industrial economy for a new South. Southern industry expanded after the Reconstruction Era via textile manufacturing. Textile factories were drawn to water power, cheap labor, low taxes, and the accommodating conservative governments. Iron and later steel industry grew rapidly. Railroad development also increased.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>More Revolutions</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">The United States experienced progress in humanities through a number of revolutions. Those revolutions include: the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, an Information Revolution, and a Digital Revolution.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The first Industrial Revolution used water and steam power to mechanize production.</li><br>
                <li>The second used electric power to create mass production.</li><br>
                <li>The third used electronics and information technology to automate production.</li><br>
                <li>The fourth is building on the third and called a Digital Revolution. It's characterized by a blend of technologies between the physical digital and biological spheres. It's disrupting almost every industry.<br><br>The factory system led to the growth of the nation's cities. The result? An increase in national wealth, better living standards for most of the population, and the creation of new fortunes.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Undergoing Industrialization &  Immigration</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">Industrialists tried to justify their power and persuade the public that everyone had something to gain from it. Industrialization brought progress and pain to America in the late 19th century.<br><br>Most workers experienced a rise in their standard of living, but the cost was difficult and dangerous working conditions, diminishing control over their own work, and a growing sense of powerlessness. The industrial workforce expanded because of massive migration into industrial cities.</p>
            <ol><b>The Effects</b>
                <li>Rural Americans flowed into factory towns and cities because they were disappointed with their lives on their farm or bankrupt. Some moved to the developing farm lands of the West. Among those people were black men and women trying to escape poverty, death, violence, and oppression from the rural South. They seeked opportunities in the cities.</li><br>
                <li>There was a great wave of immigration from abroad. Mostly from Europe but also from Asia, Canada, Mexico, etc. 25 million immigrants arrived between 1865 and 1915. Between the 1870s and 1880s, most of the immigrants came from England, Ireland, and Northern Europe. By the end of the century, there were larger numbers of Southern and Eastern Europeans who joined the workforce which included the Italians, Poles, Russians, Greeks, Slavs, etc.<br><br> Immigrants wanted to escape poverty and oppression from their homelands and were attracted by expectations of new opportunities. The growth of industry and commerce made America's reputation greater.</li><br>
                <li>The U.S. had transformed from an agrarian republic to an urban nation. Urbanization was shocking for Americans. The urban population increased sevenfold since the Civil War. In 1920, for the first time, people mostly lived in urban areas. Urban families had a high rate of infant mortality, a declining fertility rate, and a high death rate from disease. New types of housing were developed where two or three families occupied a single home. Tenements were overcrowded and unsanitary. Safe drinking water became a problem too.</li><br>
                <li>Five thousand immigrants each year at the beginning of the 19th century grew substantially to 600,000 immigrants each year in the 1830s. Then 1.7 million in the 1840s, when harvest across Europe failed, to 2.6 million in the 1850s. Most of them came from Germany, Ireland, and Scandinavia pushed by famine, eviction from farmlands, political unrest, and destruction of handicrafts by factories. They were pulled by economic opportunity and political & religious freedom. 75% of the 21 million immigrants entered through New York Bay at Ellis Island.</li><br>
                <li>Immigration brought fears of new diseases and new germs being introduced. That's why immigrants at Ellis Island were examined by medical officers. If evidence of dangerous, contagious diseases were found, immigrants could be deported. Trachoma was an infectious eye disease that could lead to blindness and was a leading reason to exclude immigrants. The examinations were very painful.</li><br>
                <li>After 1890, fewer arrivals were from northern and western Europe countries. More arrivals were from Southern and Eastern Europe. For example, Jewish people were escaping political & economic oppression in Russia & Eastern Europe and Italians were escaping poverty. More people were also coming from Syria, Turkey and Armenia.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Economic Theories</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Social Darwinism</b><br>Social Darwinism came from Charles Darwin's theory of biological evolution. Some individuals of a species flourish and pass their traits along to the next generation while others do not and that is called natural selection. The best adapted individuals would survive. This is the evolution of human society.<br><br>Economists found a way to justify the doctrine of <i>laissez-faire</i> (allow to do) which means the government has no control over businesses. William G Sumner promoted the theory that success and failure in business were governed by natural law and that no one had the right to intervene. The theory supported the idea of individual responsibility and blame. Riches were a sign of God's favor so the poor were thought to be lazy or inferior people who deserved the life they had.</li><br>
                <li><b><i>If you can't beat them join them.</i></b><br>People pursued horizontal integration in the form of mergers which usually occur when one Corporation bought the stock of another. A firm that buys out all its competitors could achieve a monopoly which allows them to control the industry's production, wages, and prices.<br><br>Another approach to mergers is known as vertical integration where connections with competing companies in trust agreements are made. This is illegal today. Participants could turn their stock over to a group of trustees who ran the separate companies as one large organization. The companies were entitled to dividends on profits earned by the trust. By the end of the century, groups began to attack monopolies and economic concentration. Monopolies eliminated competition and concerns whatever prices they wished. Railroads charged high rates because they knew their customers had to pay them. These types of businessmen were considered robber barons because they were ruthless in their goals to achieve success.</li><br>
                <li><b>Gospel of Wealth</b><br>The Gospel of Wealth attempted to temper Social Darwinism with a gentler idea. People of great wealth not only had great power but also had a great responsibility to use their riches to advance social progress. Andrew Carnegie wrote that people of wealth should consider all revenues in excess of their own needs for the good of the community. Carnegie donated large parts of his fortune to philanthropic works. The idea of great wealth was available to all. You could begin on the lowest rung of the economic ladder and work yourself to success. They were like Rags to Riches Tales. Through honesty, hard work, and aggressiveness, the impoverished could rise in the world to become successful. These businessmen were considered to be captains of industry because they gave large sums of their personal wealth to the arts, museums, etc. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Business and Types of Businessmen</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Big Business</b><br>Corporations were growing larger. They were more powerful politically and socially because they formed a web of interconnected relationships with each other to influence governors, legislators, Congress, and presidents. America got bigger through its towns, cities, ships, locomotives, factories, machines, mines, and mills.</li><br>
                <li><b>Robber Barons</b><br>"Our public companies already wield gigantic power, and they use it like unscrupulous, Unethical, Giants". These men were driven by the desire to become rich and influential. They found innovative and occasionally illegal ways to increase production, create efficiencies, and eliminate competition. These Robber Barons believe they benefited the general public by accelerating the industrial Revolution. They created jobs and grew the economy.</li><br>
                <li><b>Captains of Industry</b><br>Captains of Industry gave their money away to support education and medicine, becoming the world's leading philanthropists.Ex: John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, John Pierpont Morgan, And Cornelius Vanderbilt.<br><br>Ex: John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, John Pierpont Morgan, and Cornelius Vanderbilt.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h4>American Businessmen</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <ul>
                <li>Cornelius Vanderbilt paid low wages and didn't care about laws. He charged tolls in railroads and had a hostile takeover to gain a monopoly. Though his businesses increased in efficiency and donated money.</li><br>
                <li>John D. Rockefeller tried to gain an oil monopoly. However, he lowered oil prices, donated $500 million for a medical school to cure yellow fever and created the University of Chicago.</li><br>
                <li>John Pierpont Morgan made a finance and banking monopoly.</li><br>
                <li>Andrew Carnegie owned a steel mill in Homestead Pennsylvania</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h4>American Workers</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">Andrew Carnegie's steel mill had two types of workers. Eight hundred skilled workers worked at the mill which had 3800 employees. They were members of a craft union called the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers which helped them gain wages between $35 to $70 a week and an 8 hour work day. They could make decisions about their working conditions and what materials to use and how to get work done. These skilled workers were either American natives whose ancestors came from northern Europe (particularly Great Britain and Germany).<br><br>The majority of the workers were unskilled. They did the lifting, shoveling, and pushing. They worked 12 hours a day, two vacation days a year, and less than $10 a week. The union didn't care about these people. They viewed skilled workers as the most important part of the steel making process. Most of the unskilled workers were recent immigrants, peasants from Eastern Europe who could barely speak English. Skilled workers did not like associating with the new immigrants.<br><br>All of them suffered in the steel mills seeing as deaths and injuries from explosions, burnings, electric shocks, falls, crushing, etc. were frequent. Everyone's house was often owned by the company so they could be evicted without warning. If you lost your job, you lost your home. However, the union defended them from their employer but the unskilled did not. Carnegie tried to eliminate the union but failed. Complex tasks were broken down and divided among unskilled people and then machines were brought in. In the employer's mind, troublesome skilled workers wouldn't be needed, the union would be eliminated, and profits would increase.<br><br>Henry Clay Frick was a professional <i>Union Buster</i>. He built a 12 ft high fence around the entire plant with barbed wire and holes for guns. He gave the workers a final offer: take a pay cut or the union will be broken. They wanted to have a strike, but they didn't know if the unskilled workers would support it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>The Irish Famine</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">The Irish famine began with the failure of the potato crop in 1846. Ireland was conquered by England with its lands owned by wealthy English lords and businessmen. Irish laborers were used to harvest crops for profit. The English Lords weren't interested in the welfare of their workers so they planted a single crop: potatoes.<br><br>Potatoes were cheap to plant, grew well in the Irish climate, and could be sold to a larger market. Around 1844, a potato disease called blight destroyed both the crops and the stores of potatoes used by Irish laborers for food. This led to starvation. The Irish famine was a result of over-reliance on a single crop.<br><br>The British barely helped the Irish seeing as they allowed a crop failure to turn into a full-scale famine. Ireland was seen as a source of profit. The British believed in laissez-faire so they didn't think that government intervention was necessary. The Irish were seen as inferior which led to prejudicial philosophies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providentialism was a theory that the Irish had brought the famine upon themselves by offending God because they were Catholic instead of Protestant Christians. Therefore, the famine was an act of divine will against the heretical Catholics.</li><br>
                <li>Moralism said that the Irish shortcomings where do to moral and personal inadequacies. The Irish brought this upon themselves because they were lazy so why should the English help.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size:100%">In two years more, than 750,000 Irish died and another 2 million left their homeland for Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. The Irish population was reduced by 1/4 and 500,000 Irish went to America between 1845 & 1850 and accounted for more than half of all the immigrants in that decade.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>The Chinese</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">The Chinese were initially welcomed into America because they were seen as a source of labor for the railroad construction. However, later on in the 1800's, the Chinese were not welcomed because people feared that they were gaining control over industries and were rising above monopolies.<br><br>The Chinese were controlling the boots, shoe, and cigar industries. They also controlled textile factories. Additionally, they monopolized nearly all the farming done to supply the market with all sorts of vegetables. As a result, there is competition and a notable difference in the quality of life between our European Americans and the Chinese.<br><br>Americans were very prejudiced against the Chinese. The Chinese were excellent and faithful workers, but for some reason, someone had to supervise them. The Chinese were persecuted for their virtues and good qualities, despite attempting assimilation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>America Feared Immigration</h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">Many American natives saw immigration as a threat to their way of living and their jobs. These nativists were also typically racists who thought the Anglo-Saxon Americans like the British or Germans were superior to the Slavic, Italian, Greek, Irish, and Jewish newcomers. Illinois Italian criminals were believed to have created a lack of jobs and rob banks. This is an example of the surge in anti-immigrant sentiment & nativism. Each new group suffered discrimination. Earlier groups looked down upon newcomers. Immigrants were blamed for job shortages, rising crime rates, and poor living conditions in cities.</p>
            <ul><b>Legal Actions Against Immigration</b>
                <li>The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned most Chinese from immigrating to the United States.</li><br>
                <li>The Gentleman's Agreement of 1907 forbade the Japanese from entering the United States.</li><br>
                <li>The Immigration Act of 1917 created a list of "undesirables" based on physical and mental abilities, political beliefs and race. America didn't want to accept illiterate people over 16, anarchists, polygamists, and those who lived in the Asiatic Barred Zone.</li><br>
                <li>The National Origins Act of 1924 reduced immigration from Southern and Eastern European countries. Only 150,000 Europeans were allowed to enter the U.S. annually instead of the millions from before.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size:100%">Quotas, set amounts, limited immigration from any one country to 2% of the number of people from that country who live in the U.S. More than 80% of the 150,000 spaces were reserved for Northern Europeans mostly from Great Britain.<br><br>Some people believed that immigrants who wanted to find Opportunities needed qualities that would help Society otherwise they shouldn't be coming in at all.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Obeying a Better Immigration Law </h4>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p style="font-size:100%">The 1965 Hart-Cellar Act, brought an end to immigration limits based on race, religion, color and national origin. It overturned the:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chinese Exclusion Act</li>
                <li>Gentleman's Agreement</li>
                <li>Immigration Act of 1917</li>
                <li>National Origins Act of 1924</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size:100%">The main factors of immigration selection were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Job or skill of the potential immigrant</li>
                <li>Preference was given to those who had relatives already in the US.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size:100%">European immigration decreased, Asian immigration increased, the Americas increased, African immigration increased a little, Oceania immigration increased very little, and those that were not specified decreased a little.</p>
